# Disclaimer before Delineation 🔔

Hello amigos and amigas !! 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻

This project is just an experimention to get some hands on experience with **R programming** and speaking of which, was a **knity** experience of nasty and roller-coaster ride.

I personally felt that **R programming** is **great** for praticing purposes' and others alike. It's better to pratice in **R** few days when getting hands dirty with **Machine learning** or **Deep learning** as a beginner and can continue if you'd like to keep using **R**.

I personally enjoyed **R programming** as it gave me even more clear picture of what is to be done if you'd want to **implement from scratch**

Though, the dataset, I used is quite old for the kind of project this is but, I had great a experience playing around with it. ✨

The above opinion is completely subjective. 🙌🏻

# Delineation 🧮

## Variables which contain plots 🖍✍📐

- **Cases_worldwide_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an overall idea of worldwide **covid-1**9 aka **SARS-COVID** cases comparison.

- **Plotting_Confirmed_cases_China_Vs_world** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which juxtaposes covid-19 cases of **China** with the **rest of the world**.

- **WHO_data_plot** <br>
  There was trend in the way, the cases in china started to mutliply in number and **WHO** i.e., **World health organization** had released a data on a due note to that trend and this variable gives the plot of that trend.

- **China_cases_surge_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which shows clearly that the increase in the number of cases in china was strictly from **February 15th, 2020**.

- **Not_China_cases_plot_with_log_scale** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which an insight about the cases in rest of world excluding China i.e., by `filtering the cases of 'not from China' and comparing them with the rest of the world.

- **Top_countries_with_most_cases** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an insight about the countries outside china that have been disrupted abruptly with massive covid-19 cases.

- **Final_countrywise_cases_line_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an insight about the most effected countries by juxtaposing them.
