# Delineation 🧮
Hello amigos and amigas !! 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻
This project is just an experimention to get some hands on experience with **R programming**. 🙌🏻

## Variables which contain plots 🖍✍📐

- **Cases_worldwide_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an overall idea of worldwide **covid-1**9 aka **SARS-COVID** cases comparison.

- **Plotting_Confirmed_cases_China_Vs_world** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which juxtaposes covid-19 cases of **China** with the **rest of the world**.

- **WHO_data_plot** <br>
  There was trend in the way, the cases in china started to mutliply in number and **WHO** i.e., **World health organization** had released a data on a due note to that trend and this variable gives the plot of that trend.

- **China_cases_surge_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which shows clearly that the increase in the number of cases in china was strictly from **February 15th, 2020**.

- **Not_China_cases_plot_with_log_scale** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which an insight about the cases in rest of world excluding China i.e., by `filtering the cases of 'not from China' and comparing them with the rest of the world.

- **Top_countries_with_most_cases** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an insight about the countries outside china that have been disrupted abruptly with massive covid-19 cases.

- **Final_countrywise_cases_line_plot** <br>
  This variable gives a plot which gives an insight about the most effected countries by juxtaposing them.
